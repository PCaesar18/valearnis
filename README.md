# valearnis exercise
This is a repository for an exercise created by the company Valearnis. It contains code for a flask app. 

The original goal/exercise is stated below:

*The goal of this assignment is to create a simple AI application that uses OpenAI's GPT-3 API to generate text based on user input. The application should be able to understand user input and generate relevant responses using GPT-3, while also utilizing natural language processing techniques to improve the accuracy and relevance of responses.*

To run the app, clone the repository and run the following command in the root directory:
`git clone `

Create a virtual environment and activate it:

`python -m venv env`

`source venv/bin/activate`

Make sure to install all the requirements:
